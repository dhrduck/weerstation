# weerstation
I am trying to build a multiroom weather station - with RF, arduino and raspberry pi
This is my first larger programming project, which will involve in the programming of multiples Arduino's that will communicate weatherdata with an raspberry pi. This raspberry pi will be the main server - which needs to become an webserver which show the data and also performs data analysis over longer times. The plans are to use, PHP, Python and R on the Pi.
